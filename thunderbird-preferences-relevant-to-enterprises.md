# Thunderbird Preferences Relevant to Enterprises

### New Email Account Provisioning

Account Provisioning allows users to sign up for new email accounts from _gandi.net_ directly from within Thunderbird.

* **mail.provider.enabled**
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: If the user does not have an account set up, they will be presented with an option to sign up for a new account. They may choose to set up an existing account that they hold instead of obtaining a new one.
  * New in Thunderbird 13

### Filelink \(cloud attachments\) <a id="Filelink"></a>

Filelink is a feature that allows users to upload big files to various servers and send a link to the attachment in the email, rather than the attachment itself. This has benefits for sending the email, especially when sending to multiple users. The message will be small in size and can be sent and received faster.

Thunderbird offers an option to use WeTransfer as a cloud service. It is possible to set up other providers.

* **mail.cloud\_files.enabled**
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Prompts the user to see if they wish to send a link for big file attachments, rather than the link itself.
  * New in Thunderbird 13

### Chat \(Instant Messaging\) <a id="Instant_Messaging"></a>

Thunderbird's chat component allows the user to access different types of instant messaging accounts.

* **mail.chat.enabled**
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Enables access to the Instant Messaging user interface in Thunderbird
  * New in Thunderbird 13

### HTML rendering in message reader <a id="HTML"></a>

By default all HTML elements are interpreted by the Thunderbird HTML parser. For the message reader, there are some options to control which HTML elements will get rendered. Note that some of these preferences may not be effective for composition, especially when using Edit as New Message or Forward, which may load remote content and media anyway.

* **mailnews.display.html\_as**
  * Default: 0
  * Default Action: Show original HTML
  * Custom values: 1 or 3
  * Notes:
    * This preference can be controlled through the menu: `View`  &gt; `Message Body As` &gt; `Original HTML (0)` \| `Simple HTML (3)` \| `Plain Text (1)` 
    * Original HTML \(0\) renders all elements, subject to global and per-message or per-origin Remote Content Options.
    * Simple HTML \(3\) prevents the display of any remote content. Furthermore, this display mode can be finetuned using the html\_sanitizer preferences below.
    * Plain Text \(0\) prevents the display of remote content and displays HTML downgraded to plain text. 
* **mailnews.display.html\_sanitizer.drop\_media**

  * Default: false
  * Default Action: Allows all media files.
  * Notes:
    * Only applies to messages viewed as Simple HTML \(mailnews.display.html\_as = 3, see above\).
    * To prevent rendering &lt;img&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, i.e. to prevent images, audios, and videos from being displayed, set this preference to true.
  * New in Thunderbird 14

* **mailnews.display.html\_sanitizer.drop\_non\_css\_presentation**

  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Drop non-CSS presentational HTML elements and attributes, such as &lt;font&gt;, &lt;center&gt; and _bgcolor._
  * Notes:
    * Only applies to messages viewed as Simple HTML \(mailnews.display.html\_as = 3, see above\).
  * New in Thunderbird 14

* **Obsolete**: mailnews.display.html\_sanitizer.allowed\_tags
  * Default: \[Long list of HTML tags\]
  * Default Action: Allows specified elements to be interpreted by Thunderbird's HTML parser
  * Notes:
    * Obsolete after Thunderbird 13, use **mailnews.display.html\_sanitizer.drop\_media** and **mailnews.display.html\_sanitizer.drop\_non\_css\_presentation** instead. The preference will be automatically migrated to the new preferences if necessary.

### Offline Download / Synchronisation 

* **mail.server.default.offline\_download**
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Used to determine if newly created folders are set to take part in offline download or not.
  * Notes: This is the default value for all servers/accounts when the mail.server.server&lt;n&gt;.offline\_download preference is not set.
* **mail.server.server&lt;n&gt;.offline\_download**
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Used to determine if newly created folders are set to take part in offline download or not.
  * Notes:
    * This value is typically not present unless it has been specifically overridden.
    * Overrides mail.server.default.offline\_download for server&lt;n&gt;

Both preferences now also have the behaviour that if offline\_download is true for an account/server, then on upgrade from Thunderbird 2, all existing IMAP folders will be updated to take part in offline download.

### Version Upgrades  <a id="Version_Upgrades"></a>

#### Prompt for third-party Add-ons \(untested\)

Note: Starting with Thunderbird 78, traditional addons have been discontinued for security reasons. Addons are now generally expected to be Web Extensions using the APIs provided by Thunderbird.

* **extensions.autoDisableScopes**
  * Default: 15
  * Default Action: **When upgrading to a build from before Thunderbird 10 to after, the user will be prompted about add-ons installed by third parties.**
  * Notes:
    * This preference is a bit-wise OR of values that control the locations for which add-ons are prompted about as third-parties. **Organizations typically want to set this to 11 if they are installing their own add-ons.** The bit values are as follows:
      * 1: Installed in the profile
      * 2: Installed for all of this user's profile
      * 4: Installed and owned by the Application
      * 8: Installed for all users of the computer

#### Migration Assistant for Profiles from Version 3.0 or earlier <a id="Migration_Assistant"></a>

* **Obsolete:** mailnews.ui.show.migration.on.upgrade
  * Default: true
  * Default Action: Shows the migration assistant when we're upgrading a profile from 3.0 or earlier.
